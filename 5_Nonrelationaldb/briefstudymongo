Mongodb

1)Mongodb is one of the nonrelational databases , that is completely different from relational databases.According to me it has flexible way to write commands.

2)In schema design it is completely different from relational databases(SQL),Because we can write multiple collections inside one collection.Here are some tems that are used in mongodb , they are:
	1)collection
	2)Documents
	3)(key,vale)

	2.1 In terms of relational databases,collection can be set of documents where document can be set of records and (key,value) these are actual field names and 		their values.

3)If we are having related collections,then there is no need to create saperate collections,just we can put it in one collection and map collections.

4)We also can use (unique objectId of an id) in our way,that is (x=ObjectId),so whenever there is need of objectId we can simply use the (x).
